* Added escapes for a few known special characters.

* Fixed inline LaTeX parsing (issue [#24](http://github.com/tristanjuricek/knockoff/issues/closed#issue/24)).

* Added the SnuggleTeX dependency to spit out MathML in the Wholesaler for
  previously mentioned inline TeX. I note that MathML is kind of, well, poorly
  supported, so YMMV.

* Big revision of the literate markdown.

* Fixed problems when combining MetaData with the SCAML writer.
