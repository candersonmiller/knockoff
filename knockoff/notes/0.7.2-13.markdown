* Added the `SCAMLWriter` with associated `toSCAML` method, in case you want to
  pepper your markdown files with SCAML - and then use [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org)
  to process them. (_Note_ No SSP... yet.)

* Specification bugfix whereupon hard breaks are properly broken with `<br/>`s
  instead of splitting the two lines into separate paragraphs.
