Two small bug fixes:

1. A reference link followed by a paren was being matched as a normal link.

1. If you used an asterix-delimited em right after a list item asterix marker, the
   line is now considered to be a list item if you use an odd number of asterixes
   on the line. (Ugly, but generally going to be OK.)
