This is a major revision of the project. Your code will probably break if you did
something other than just convert simple markdown to XHTML.

Generally speaking, the project is taking a few ideas from [pandoc][], starting
with output to LaTeX.

* Redid the entire object model to remove the `xml` and `markdown` methods, and the
  silly little object factory. If you need to customize the output, override one
  of the `FooWriter` traits.

* Added plain text and a *preliminary* LaTeX writer.

* Fixed an issue where two spaces at the end of the line were not breaking into
  separate paragraphs.
  
* Removed the use of perl for the integration tests. Everything should be kicked
  off by the `test` command.
  
* Cross-compiled for Scala 2.7.4-2.8.0.Beta1 for the 1.5 JVM. The core project did
  run under 2.8.0 recently, but getting the sbt configuration straight for ScalaTest
  isn't as "plug and play" as I would have liked.
