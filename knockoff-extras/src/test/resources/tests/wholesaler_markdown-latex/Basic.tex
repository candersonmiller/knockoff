\section{I suppose this could be an article}

This test was written\footnote{An Example http://example.com} by me when I really haven't
used $\LaTeX$ in a very long time.


\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

So please take these things into account:


\begin{enumerate}
\item I could be completely wrong.

\item This might be completely useless.

\end{enumerate}

In other words, this is a beta feature, caveat emptor.
