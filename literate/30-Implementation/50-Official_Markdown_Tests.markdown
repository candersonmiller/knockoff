The Official Tests
==================

There *are* unit tests, but those are mostly sanity checks and help around debugging
problems. The [MarkdownTest][1] scripts are checked into the tree, and a script,
`test`, can be used to run the test suite.

## Requirements ##

1. Perl
2. `tidy` on the path.
3. Run this command: `sbt literate package`
