Subject: Things I have To Do

* Investigate why the list tests are failing

# Add simple and complex list evaluation #
* The header starts by ... being not implemented
* The complex versus simple items are not cleanly sorted. We should only go to using
  internal <p> elements if there are truly complex statements. Hm...


* Add code sequence evaluation
* Add header inclusion
* Add quotes in quotes parsing and evaluation

... fix all MarkdownTest tests...
