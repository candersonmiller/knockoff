Unit tests are probably a good idea. Specifications around things?

1. Write specs around each of these tiny classes, kind of uninteresting, but

2. The wrapper that calls these tiny classes needs to have a few more 
   interesting tests, but then again, maybe that's just more intelligent
   testing.
