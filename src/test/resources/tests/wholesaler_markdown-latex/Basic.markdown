# I suppose this could be an article #

This test was [written](http://example.com "An Example") by me when I really haven't
used $\LaTeX$ in a very long time.

    \begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
    \end{equation}

So please take these things into account:

1. I could be completely wrong.
2. This might be completely useless.

In other words, this is a beta feature, caveat emptor.
